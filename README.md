Game Concept – “Duality” (working title)

You control two entities:
– One representing Good
– The other representing Evil

Your goal is to guide both characters to the end of each level. However, things aren’t so simple — each character faces obstacles tied to their nature.

The Evil entity is driven to destroy creatures, while the Good entity must help or save others. These two beings are actually the split parts of a single soul, divided for mysterious reasons. Now, they must journey through increasingly dangerous and puzzling levels in order to be reunited.

Core Mechanics:
The two entities are linked, meaning certain key actions — like exiting a level, activating a power, or using an item — must be performed simultaneously.

Each character has their own version of the level: same size, but different elements. For example, one might need to stand on a switch to open a bridge in the other’s world — and must stay there to keep it open.

Progression introduces increased difficulty:

Reduced margin for error

Decreasing time limits

Introduction of new abilities that must be used precisely

Environmental hazards and puzzles that require tighter coordination

Gameplay Features:
Switches: Trigger effects in the other entity’s world (e.g. doors, platforms, traps).

Item Transfer: Objects or buffs passed between entities to solve puzzles.

Curses/Maluses: Negative effects like inverted controls or swapped abilities, affecting one or both characters.

Lore Setting:
Set in a rich fantasy world filled with magic, monsters, and mythical creatures, the story gradually reveals how the two entities were split and why they must come together again — not just to survive, but to restore balance to a broken world.
